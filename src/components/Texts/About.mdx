## About me

Hey! My name is Gavin and I like to experiment and make things for the web.
I've spent the last couple of years getting to know this world and have been
astounded at how deep it all is

For the last few years I've been living in Spain and working as a teacher.
While I've had a lot of fun doing this I've fallen in love with everything to
do with building things online. Every new piece of the puzzle that falls into
place fills me with a tremendous sense of satisfaction.

I'd love to be able to share my passion for this work in a more professional
space so if you think we might be able to do some great work together please<a href="/contact">reach out!</a>
