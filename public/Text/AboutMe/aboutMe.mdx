## Hi! I'm Gavin<br/><br/>

I live in Northern Spain with my husband and my two cats, Bob and Simon.<br/><br/>

Some quick facts about me:<br/><br/>

{" "}

<ul>
  <li>I'm 182cm tall</li>
  <li>My favourite food is anything spicy (but especially Mexican)</li>
  <li>I love cycling, hiking and learning</li>
  <li>I can't stand mushrooms</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />

I've always been curious about the world around me and some time ago this led me to learn how to build things with computers. The thing that most excites me is the process
of having an idea and then realising it. The challenges I've faced along the way have been the best
instructors I could have asked for.<br/><br/>

Although I've learned a lot, one of the reasons I've grown to love making things with code so much
is that there is always more to learn. It's an endless journey and the more I grow as a developer
the more I love what I do! Each time something new clicks I feel even more excited to to move onto
something even more complex.<br/><br/>
